This guide lets you quickly install Kmesh.

## Preparation

Kmesh needs to run on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes 1.26, 1.27, 1.28 are currently supported. We recommend using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) to quickly build a Kubernetes cluster (We provide a [document](https://kmesh.net/en/docs/setup/develop_with_kind/) for developing and deploying Kmesh using kind). Of course, you can also use minikube and other ways to create Kubernetes clusters.

The complete Kmesh capability depends on the OS enhancement. Check whether the execution environment is in the [OS list](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/docs/kmesh_support.md) supported by Kmesh. For other OS environments, see [Kmesh Compilation and Building](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/docs/kmesh_compile.md).You can also try the [Kmesh image in compatibility mode](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/build/docker/README.md) in other OS environments.For information on various Kmesh images, please refer to the [detailed document](https://github.com/kmesh-net/kmesh/blob/main/build/docker/README.md).

Currently, Kmesh connects to the Istio control plane. Before starting Kmesh, install the Istio control plane software. We recommend installing istio ambient mode because Kmesh ads mode need it. For details, see [ambient mode istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/ambient/getting-started/).

You can view the results of istio installation using the following command:

```console
kubectl get po -n istio-system 
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
istio-cni-node-xbc85      1/1     Running   0          18h
istiod-5659cfbd55-9s92d   1/1     Running   0          18h
ztunnel-4jlvv             1/1     Running   0          18h
```

Note: To use waypoint you need to install the Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs, which donâ€™t come installed by default on most Kubernetes clusters:

```console
kubectl get crd gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io &> /dev/null || \
  { kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd/experimental?ref=444631bfe06f3bcca5d0eadf1857eac1d369421d" | kubectl apply -f -; }
```

## Install Kmesh

We offer several ways to install Kmesh

- Install from Helm
  
```console
helm install kmesh ./deploy/helm -n kmesh-system --create-namespace
```

- Alternatively install from Yaml
  
```console
kubectl create namespace kmesh-system
kubectl apply -f ./deploy/yaml/
```

You can confirm the status of Kmesh with the following command:

```console
kubectl get pod -n kmesh-system
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kmesh-v2frk   1/1     Running   0          18h
```

View the running status of Kmesh service:

```console
time="2024-04-25T13:17:40Z" level=info msg="bpf Start successful" subsys=manager
time="2024-04-25T13:17:40Z" level=info msg="controller Start successful" subsys=manager

time="2024-04-25T13:17:41Z" level=info msg="command Start cni successful" subsys=manager
```

## Deploy the Sample Applications

Similar to istio, Kmesh can be used to manage applications in a namespace by adding a label to that namespace.

```console
# Enable Kmesh for the specified namespace
kubectl label namespace default istio.io/dataplane-mode=Kmesh
```

Apply the following configuration to create sample applications:

```console
kubectl apply -f ./samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml

kubectl apply -f ./samples/sleep/sleep.yaml
```

Check sample applications status:

```console
kubectl get pod 
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
httpbin-65975d4c6f-96kgw                  1/1     Running   0          3h38m
sleep-7656cf8794-8tp9n                    1/1     Running   0          3h38m
```

You can determine if a pod is managed by Kmesh by looking at the pod's annotation.

```console
kubectl describe po httpbin-65975d4c6f-96kgw | grep Annotations

Annotations:      kmesh.net/redirection: enabled
```

## Test Sample Applications

After the applications have been manage by Kmesh, we need to test that they are still working properly.

```console
kubectl exec sleep-7656cf8794-xjndm -c sleep -- curl -IsS "http://httpbin:8000/status/200"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: gunicorn/19.9.0
Date: Sun, 28 Apr 2024 07:31:51 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
Content-Length: 0
```

Note: 10.244.0.21 is the IP of httpbin

## Clean Up

If you don't want to use Kmesh to govern the application anymore, you can delete the labels on the namespace and restart the pod.

```console
kubectl label namespace default istio.io/dataplane-mode-
kubectl delete pod httpbin-65975d4c6f-96kgw sleep-7656cf8794-8tp9n
kubectl describe pod httpbin-65975d4c6f-h2r99 | grep Annotations

Annotations:      <none>
```

Delete Kmesh:

- If you installed Kmesh using helm

```console
helm uninstall kmesh -n kmesh-system
kubectl delete ns kmesh-system
```

- If you installed Kmesh using yaml:

```console
kubectl delete -f ./deploy/yaml/
```

To remove the sleep and httpbin applications:

```console
kubectl delete -f samples/httpbin/httpbin.yaml
kubeclt delete -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml
```

If you installed the Gateway API CRDs, remove them:

```console
kubectl kustomize "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/config/crd/experimental?ref=444631bfe06f3bcca5d0eadf1857eac1d369421d" | kubectl delete -f -
```
